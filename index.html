          <h2>Introduction</h2>
        </header>
        <p>MAN MEETS MAGIC & MACHINE. The year is 2054. Magic has returned to the world, awakening powerful creatures of myth and legend. Technology merges with flesh and consciousness. Elves, trolls, orks and dwarves walk among us, while ruthless corporations bleed the world dry. You are a shadowrunner - a mercenary living on the fringes of society, in the shadows of massive corporate arcologies, surviving day-by-day on skill and instinct alone. When the powerful or the desperate need a job done, you get it done... by any means necessary.</p>

<p>In the urban sprawl of the Seattle metroplex, the search for a mysterious killer sets you on a trail that leads from the darkest slums to the city’s most powerful megacorps. You will need to tread carefully, enlist the aid of other runners, and master powerful forces of technology and magic in order to emerge from the shadows of Seattle unscathed.</p>

<p>The unique cyberpunk-meets-fantasy world of Shadowrun has gained a huge cult following since its creation nearly 25 years ago. Now, creator Jordan Weisman returns to the world of Shadowrun, modernizing this classic game setting as a single player, turn-based tactical RPG.</p>
        <h3>Key Features</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Gripping Tactical Combat: When you’re running the shadows, every turn matters. Choose your actions wisely - move to better cover, charge into melee, or lob a fireball into a crowd of enemies. With the variety of weapons and spells at your disposal, every turn is filled with meaningful choices. A successful run requires commanding a team of runners with the right balance of combat, tech, and magical abilities.</li>
          <li>Skill-Based Character Progression: Choose a starting character archetype and build from there! Street Samurai and Physical Adepts use advanced combat skills to dominate the battlefield, Shamans and Mages summon powerful allies and cast deadly spells, while Riggers and Deckers provide critical technological support, projecting their consciousness directly into drones and computer systems. Shadowrun Returns’ classless skill system allows you to grow your character in any direction you choose. Want to start summoning spirits as an ork Shaman and evolve into a cybered-up weapon specialist? Do it!</li>
          <li>Engaging 2D/3D Art Style: Shadowrun Returns mixes dynamic 3D characters and lighting with a vibrant, hand-painted environment. Illustrated character portraits bring every conversation to life. Explore a world filled with detail, from the slums of the Redmond Barrens to the extravagant offices of powerful corporations.</li>

          <h3>Humans</h3>
          <p>Humans were the the only race on earth until the Awakening in 2012. Now they find themselves the definition of average or even normal. They are still the most populous race in world and thus control many of the most powerful, monied, and important positions in society.</p>
          <p>All Humans have a +3 to Karma to start the game</p>

          <h3>Elves</h3>
          <p>Many people, especially other metahuman races, see elves as the most fortunate metahumans. They are more attractive and socially acceptable than the other metahumans. Elves are taller than humans but have a more slender build. Their hari is usually thicker, longer, and more luxurious than average and their ears come to a point.</p>
          <p>All Elves have a +1 to Charisma</p>

        <div>
          <h3>Dwarves</h3>
          <p>Dwarves are the shortest of the metahuman races. To compensate, their torsos and shoulders are wider than their size would indicate. Thus their strength is equal to, and sometimes greater than, the larger races. A side effect of their metahuman nature is increased resistance to pathogens and magic that attacks from within.</p>
          <p>All Dwarves have a +1 to Willpower</p>
          <code>

          <h3>Orks</h3>
          <p>Orks are the fastest-breeding race and now are second only to humans in world population. Their size leads to an intimidating silhouette and a body that can tkae more physical damage than the average. Orks have pointed ears and intimidating teeth or tusks.</p>
          <p>All Orks have a +3 to Body</p>
          <code>

          <h3>Trolls</h3>
          <p>Trolls are the largest metahuman race. Heavy prejudice against them has led people to assume trolls have lowered intelligence but in reality, there is no proof to this. Trolls have pointed ears, intimidating teeth or tusks and many have horn-like gorwths that other metahumans do not manifest.</p>
          <p>All Trolls have a +1 to Body and +1 to Strength</p>
